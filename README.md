# Algorithms
This repository lists the famous algorithms written in my way. It includes:
- Karatuda Multiplication O(n^(log3))
- Merge Sort O(nlog(n))
- Count Inversion O(nlog(n))
- Quick Sort O(nlog(n))
- Breadth First Search O(m+n) where m = # of edges and n = # of nodes
- Depth First Search O(m+n) where m = # of edges and n = # of nodes
- Topological Sort Algorithm O(m+n) where m = # of edges and n = # of nodes
- Kosaraju's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components O(m+n) where m = # of edges and n = # of nodes
